# pyterminal
A small Python library to make ANSI escape codes more accessible in Python projects.

In a nutshell, I recently discovered that Python has support for ANSI codes, as long as your system/command line supports it as well. I wanted to write a little Python file that I could add to other projects in order to make integrating these codes easier. This is that file.

I have plans to extend the functionality of this code beyond just colours in the future. I'd like to add cleaner implementations for more ANSI codes and give users more control over what they can easily implement into their code. However, I do not know the immediate direction of this project, just a rough list of features I think would be near to implement.
