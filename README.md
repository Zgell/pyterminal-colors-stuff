# PyTerminal
A small Python library to make ANSI escape codes more accessible in Python projects.

In a nutshell, I recently discovered that Python has support for ANSI codes, as long as your system/command line supports it as well. I wanted to write a little Python file that I could add to other projects in order to make integrating these codes easier. This is that file.

I have plans to extend the functionality of this code beyond just colours and formatting in the future. My end goal is to make this library capable of allowing users to create custom command line interfaces for their projects.
